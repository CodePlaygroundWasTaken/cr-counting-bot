# Counting [bot]
A Discord bot made for ~~my home server only~~ unlimited guils which is designed to manage and add to #counting channels. More specifically, this application is designed to run the *counting* game on any Discord server. When it is invited (`c?invite`) the server admins (only admins can manage the settings at this time) may set a **counting channel**. The bot will listen to that channel, and will respond to numbers that are sent in it. Bot commands can be executed from any channel the bot has the permissions to see.
