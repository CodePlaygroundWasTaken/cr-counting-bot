# counting human
A Discord bot made for any server, counting human is something cool and fun to have and enjoyable to use. The purpose of this app is to manage and enhance a channel for counting. More specifically, this application is designed to run the *counting* game on your server.

## The Counting Game

Essentially, the counting game is an activity involving counting. The server's admin(s) get final say over exactly how it is played and the rules to play it, but often the game is a challenge to see how high the members of the server can count, in sequence, until they mess up. counting human adds to the game by introducing measures of fair play, channel moderation (e.g. only allowing numbers in the channel), saves (basically "lives" for the players to use up), and more.

## Usage

When it is invited (`c?invite`) the server admins (only admins can manage the settings at this time) may set a **counting channel**. The bot will listen to that channel, and will respond to numbers that are sent in it. Bot commands can be executed from any channel the bot has the permissions to see.
